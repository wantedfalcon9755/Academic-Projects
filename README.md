My name is Siruvuri Nitin Varma and I recently completed my masterâ€™s degree in cybersecurity at the University of North Texas achieving a GPA of 3.5. I have obtained certifications, including Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) EC Council Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) and Certified Information Assurance Professional from the Defense Research & Development Organization in India. These certifications have equipped me with the skills for success in the field of cybersecurity. I'm excited about the opportunity to utilize my knowledge to contribute to your cybersecurity team.

Regarding expertise I am well versed in security tools such as Metasploit, Maltego, Nessus, Nmap, Acunetix, Qualys, Wireshark and Burp Suite. My practical experience includes security testing, risk assessment, vulnerability management and incident response. When it comes to securing web applications, I am skilled at conducting security tests while adhering to OWASP security standards. This ensures that potential security threats are identified and addressed effectively.

In my position at Spyry Technologies I had the opportunity to delve into penetration testing where I meticulously investigated security incidents. Additionally, I gained expertise in evaluating the security aspects of Android applications which has enhanced my skill set in this evolving field of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, I have an understanding of networking protocols such as TCP/IP, IDS/IPS, switching and routing, firewalls (WAF) as well as various networking services, like DNS, SSL, FTP, DHCP and SMTP.  My academic background, which includes coursework in Computer Forensics, Computer Security, Penetration Testing, and Advanced Network Security, I possess the knowledge and analytical thinking necessary to excel in a cybersecurity role. Beyond technical skills, I've showcased my teamwork and communication abilities through academic projects such as creating a crop yield prediction system and an online loan management system. These projects demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems and collaborate effectively with others. I'm eager to join a dynamic team that values innovation and continually strives to bolster security measures.
